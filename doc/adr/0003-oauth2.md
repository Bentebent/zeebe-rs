# 3. Oauth2

Date: 2025-01-12

## Status

Accepted

## Context

To be able to connect to secure self-managed clusters and Camunda cloud clusters the Zeebe client need to support oauth2 for authentication. We need a way to support oauth2.

## Decision

We have decided to use [oauth2-rs](https://github.com/ramosbugs/oauth2-rs).

## Consequences

Oauth2-rs is well established and supported implementation of oauth2 that supports both sync and async implementations. Allows for easier onboarding due to the maturity of the library, available documentation and examples.
